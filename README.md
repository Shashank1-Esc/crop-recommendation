🌾 Crop Recommendation System
This project is a machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

It uses a classification model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the optimal crop for a given set of inputs.

📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle with selecting the most suitable crop for a particular region due to varying soil and climate conditions. This system aims to assist by providing accurate crop recommendations based on historical data and scientific patterns.

✅ Features
Accepts real-world agricultural and environmental data.

Trains a machine learning model to learn crop-growing patterns.

Recommends the best crop using classification algorithms.

Provides model evaluation using accuracy score and classification report.

Easy to extend with other algorithms or real-time data inputs.

🧠 Algorithms Used
Random Forest Classifier (from scikit-learn)

Reason: Handles nonlinear data well, reduces overfitting, and is highly accurate.

You can easily extend this to include:

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

📊 Dataset
Format: CSV file

Columns:

N (Nitrogen)

P (Phosphorus)

K (Potassium)

temperature (°C)

humidity (%)

ph (soil pH level)

rainfall (mm)

label (target crop)

Size: ~4,000+ samples

Source: Crop Recommendation Dataset (publicly available on platforms like Kaggle)

🗂 Note: Place your dataset CSV inside a folder named crop_dataset before running the notebook.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

pandas

seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)

scikit-learn (for machine learning)

🚀 How to Run This Project
Upload your dataset ZIP file and extract it in Google Colab.

Ensure the CSV file is inside a folder named crop_dataset.

Run the notebook step-by-step:

Load and explore the dataset

Visualize feature correlation

Split data into train/test

Train the Random Forest model

Evaluate using test data

(Optional) Try predicting crop for a custom input using:
model.predict([[N, P, K, temp, humidity, pH, rainfall]])

📈 Output Example
Model Accuracy: 97–99% (may vary based on dataset)

Detailed classification report per crop (precision, recall, f1-score)

💡 Future Improvements
Add frontend with user input form

Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
